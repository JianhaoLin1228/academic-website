- Fragmentation impacts all biological levels 

  Habitat loss, increase patches‘ number, decrease patches size, increase patches’ isolation

- Fragmentation influences eco-evo outcomes

  1. Affects genetic variation
  1. Affects most evolutionary forces (such as the force of drift, selection, and gene flow)

- Phenotypic traits changes: traits related to mating systems, competitive skills, movement abilities, or habitat use

- Evolution of dispersal in fragmentation ([Core et al., 2017](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ecog.02538))



Here, we introduce the role of spatial structure on eco-evo interactions by showing how different aspects of fragmentation can change patterns of trait distribution through their influence on eco-evo processes.



## Spatial heterogeneity of habitats and phenotypes

stochastic events & limited dispersal: 

➡️  spatial heterogeneity in the genetic composition <-- not necessarily match --> spatial heterogeneity in environments



### Under fragmentation 

- **three** kinds of spatial and temporal heterogeneity: 

  (1) habitat vs matrix

  (2) variation across space within the matrix in its properties

  (3) variation among suitable habitat patches.



### Ecological heterogeneities ➡️ heterogeneity of phenotype distributions

- When gene flow is low: only dispersal ➡️  gene flow

- through four eco-evolutionary processes (interacted with each others)：

  1. phenotypic divergence due to **genetic drift**

  2. **local adaptation** can increase the divergence

  3. **phenotypic plasticity**

  4. **Dispersal** + habitat matching selection --> spatial sorting (i.e., non-random dispersal)

- Tasks:

  1. the tipping points at which processes will influence each other
  2. disentangle the relative effects of these different processes



### Fragmentation impacts on habitats

- This definition implies four effects of fragmentation on habitat patterns ([Fahrig 2003](https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.34.011802.132419)): 
  1. global reduction in the amount of habitat, **habitat loss**
  2. increase in the **number** of habitat patches
  3. decrease in the **size** of habitat patches
  4. increase in **isolation** among patches
- habitat patterns changes ➡️ eco-evo changes



### habitat loss

- Direct effect: a proportional loss of individuals in the remaining habitats

- Indirect effect: indirect: increased competition for resources, reduced predation, constrained movements of individuals

- Mutational meltdown in subdivided populations 

- Modifications of phenotypic distributions due to drift effect

  1. not because habityat loss

  2. But inter-patch distance and patch number 

     ➡️ Among-population divergence within metapopulations



### Increase in number/decrease in size of habitat patches

- Limited dispersal ➡️ negative effect on local **effective population sizes**

  1. losing resources ➡️ a reduction in population carrying capacities
  2. **emigration** from patches into the matrix >> inputs of **immigrants**

- **low effective population sizes ** 

  ➡️ High genetic and demographic **stochasticity** 

  ➡️ limit **local adaptation**
  
- Produce a mosaic of **distinctive local conditions** 

  ➕ **selection intensity** is high enough and **population sizes** sufficient to limit stochastic effects

  ➡️ increase local adaptation and population divergence

- Affects traits of dispersal ability：

  1. increase competition selects for higher dispersal (Frank 1986, North et al. 2011)
  2. High heterosis is regularly found in small populations

- A greater perimeter: area ratio

  ➡️ **Processes coupling patches to the surrounding matrix** are likely to be much stronger

  1. **resources flowing** in from the matrix can sustain larger populations on small fragments
  2. individuals residing in patches can make **foraging forays** into the matrix
  3. Negative effects: generalist predator ‘spillover’ into the fragments



### Increase in isolation of patches

- **increase in dispersal costs**
- The evolution of dispersal traits is shaped by the **balance** between its costs and benefits ([Clobert et al. 2012](https://books.google.com/books?hl=zh-CN&lr=&id=s3EVDAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PP1&dq=Clobert+et+al.+2012&ots=LMnzGC0SDq&sig=2QX50vOqxjnC0ve4589L_XtOJJs#v=onepage&q=Clobert%20et%20al.%202012&f=false), [Cote et al. 2017](https://nsojournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ecog.02538)).
- modify the distribution of dispersal phenotypes
- either increased or decreased dispersal, and the relationship can be non-monotonic
  1. small population + isolation ➡️ detrimental effects on fitness traits
  2. **intermediate levels** of isolation can enhance fitness evolution 



## How does fragmentation change eco-evo interactions, and the reverse?

- (Mal) adaptation can either exacerbate or invert the effects of isolation on immigration and extinction rates depending upon the studied organisms and contexts. 

### Priority effect

- Fragmentation has the potential to accelerate the monopolization of populations or species. 

- By increasing distances between patches, it increases time lags between the first and the second immigrants.

### Competitive interactions

The outcome of individual or species competition may be different throughout the fragmentation process because it can create spatial segregation of competitors across the landscape, change their demography, and/or modify the time for competitors to acquire new adaptations.

### Evolution of dispersal 

- strong selection for specialized dispersal phenotypes in response to increased patch isolation (eco → evo).
- The evolution of increased dispersal, in turn, increases functional connectivity, implying that patch isolation will decrease (evo → eco).
- In a metacommunity, some interacting species may persist only because of heterogeneity among species in dispersal rates (e.g. **colonization competition tradeoffs**), and evolutionary shifts in dispersal  can alter the likelihood of species coexistence.
