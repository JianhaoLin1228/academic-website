My research interests include theoretical ecology, community ecology, spatial ecology and eco-evolutionary dynamics.

## Theoretical Ecology

- mathematical modeling
- individual-based modeling

## Community Ecology at multiple scales

- Metacommunity ecology

## Eco-evolutionary Dynamics 

- Rapid evolution
- Rapid environmental changes: fragamentation, global warming
